Welcome to the Open 3D Engine! To learn more about contributing to the [O3DE code repo](README.md), check out the [Contributor's Guide](https://github.com/o3de/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The [O3DE community repo](https://github.com/o3de/community) contains information about how to get started, how the community organizes, and more.

## Making contributions with the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

When contributing, your pull requests will require that you have agreed to our DCO found here: [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/).  

All commits require the `--signoff` or `-s` flag to show DCO compliance. This requires that you have both your contributor name and email address in your .gitconfig file, or have previously run the following Git commands from a Git-enabled shell (This command updates your .gitconfig.): 

```
git config user.name "YOUR CONTRIBUTOR NAME HERE" 
git config user.email "YOUR CONTRIBUTOR CONTACT MAIL HERE". 
```

You must use the -s option on every commit when using a git-enabled shell or commandline. For Example: ```git commit -s -m 'my commit message'```

If you are using a Git-enabled IDE, such as Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio Code, turn on commit signing in the preferences.
